# boston_house_prediction

Project Description 📄

❄️ Built a linear regression model using scikit learn in boston data to
predict 'Price' based on other dependent variable.

#### Deployed Project Link: https://house-price-boston.herokuapp.com/

##### Jupyter Notebook: (https://github.com/shiv0112/boston_house_prediction/blob/master/notebook/Linear_reg.ipynb)

## Data:

```
:Number of Instances: 506

    :Number of Attributes: 13 numeric/categorical predictive. Median Value (attribute 14) is usually the target.

    :Attribute Information (in order):
        - CRIM     per capita crime rate by town
        - ZN       proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
        - INDUS    proportion of non-retail business acres per town
        - CHAS     Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
        - NOX      nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
        - RM       average number of rooms per dwelling
        - AGE      proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
        - DIS      weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
        - RAD      index of accessibility to radial highways
        - TAX      full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
        - PTRATIO  pupil-teacher ratio by town
        - B        1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
        - LSTAT    % lower status of the population
